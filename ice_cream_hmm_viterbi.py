    V is the main data structure that represents the trellis/grid of
    Viterbi probabilities. It is a list of dictionaries. Each
    dictionary represents one column.

    The variable 'path' maintains the currently most likely path. For
    example, once we have finished processing the third observation,
    then 'path' contains for each possible state, the currently most
    likely path that leads to that state. 'path' is a dictionary with
    one entry for each possible state. And each value is a list of
    states, representing the most likely sequence of states leading to
    the state represented by the key.+-
